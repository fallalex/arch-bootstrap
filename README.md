# arch-bootstrap

Chasing my perfect personal install has let me to create this.

## Outline
* curl and run script
* script gets ansible setup
* run ansible playbook

## Goals
* configurable yet one click
* rerunable
* modular
* easily pull in other playbooks outside of repo
* minimal shell scripts (too messy)
* usable of daily driver and one off vms
